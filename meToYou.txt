Hi there, love. I hope you find this message well.
I don't know where you're reading this, it might be next to me for all I know, but I'm sure I would've told you to open this on your laptop.
We've been together for quite a while, over a year and a half, and yet my love for you only grows and I hope you feel the same.
Lately we've been getting some, uh, more than unwelcome news, but I'm sure we'll manage. I still love you and I am NOT letting you go.
I wish you the best of Valentine's and here's to (hopefully) another 60 years of being stuck together. 
Life is still a long time away from ending, and we're sure as hell won't let people keep us apart.
I love you so much, so so so much.

From your love, Ren.
