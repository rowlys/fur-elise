Hi there, love. I hope you find this message well.
I don't know where you're reading this, it might be next to me for all I know, but I'm sure I would've told you to open this on your laptop. ( P.S I'm editing this on Valentine's and you're definitely not reading it next to me ðŸ¥² )
We've been together for quite a while now, over a year and a half, and yet my love for you only grows. Even if we're not "officially" dating, you are still the most precious person to me.
Lately we've been getting some... uh, more than unwelcome news, but I'm sure we'll manage. I still love you and I am NOT letting you go.
I wish you the best of Valentine's and here's to (hopefully) another 60 years of being stuck together. 
Life is still far from ending, and we're sure as hell won't let people keep us apart. Call me selfish, but I'm not going to let my source of happiness slip from my embrace.

I love you so much, so so so much.

From your love, Ren.
